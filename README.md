The Random Quotes Hexagon API is a Java microservice web application project for displaying random quotes via **Quotes Hub API**, is a modular and maintainable RESTful service designed using Hexagonal Architecture (also known as Ports and Adapters). Built with Java and Spring Boot, the application cleanly separates core business logic from external systems such as web APIs like **Quotes Hub API**. It delivers random quotes through a well-defined API interface, making it easy to test, extend, and adapt. The project is configured with Maven for dependency management and build automation, ensuring smooth integration and deployment workflows.

## How to Run 

This application is packaged as a jar which has Tomcat 8 embedded. No Tomcat or JBoss installation is necessary. You run it using the ```java -jar``` command.

* Clone this repository 
* Make sure you are using JDK 1.8 and Maven 3.x
* You can build the project and run the tests by running ```mvn clean package```
* Once successfully built, you can run the service by one of these two methods:
  - `java -jar target/randomquotes-hxsc-1.0.0.jar`
  - `mvn spring-boot:run` 

* Check the stdout or boot_example.log file to make sure no exceptions are thrown

Once the application runs you should see something like this

```
2025-01-01T17:42:38.008-05:00  INFO 11012 --- [randomquotes-hxsc] [  restartedMain] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer  : Tomcat started on port 8081 (http) with context path '/randomquotes-hxsc'
